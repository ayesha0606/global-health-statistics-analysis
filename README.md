# Global Health Statistics Analysis

## Problem Statement
How do healthcare access levels influence mortality outcomes across countries and disease categories?

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Records: X
- Key features: mortality_rate, healthcare_access, recovery_rate

## Approach
- Data cleaning & validation
- Aggregation at country and disease-category level
- Exploratory analysis
- Dashboard visualization

## Key Insights
- Countries with low healthcare access show consistently higher mortality
- Certain disease categories show poor outcomes despite moderate access
- Mortality variation is more pronounced across regions than diseases

## Business / Policy Implications
- Prioritize healthcare access improvements in high-risk regions
- Focus on early intervention diseases with high population impact
- Improve healthcare efficiency, not just access
## Tools
Python, Power BI
